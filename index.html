        The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was
        not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any
        laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be
        punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a
        forced-labour camp.

        In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five,
        and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they
        should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their
        position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience,
        but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied
        by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense.
        And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for
        thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.

        'Does Big Brother exist?'<br>
        'Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the embodiment
        of the Party.'<br>
        'Does he exist in the same way that I exist?'<br>
        'You do not exist.' said O'Brien.
